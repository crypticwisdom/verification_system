Task TODO:
(1) Got the error on'/channel': Error: Got AttributeError when attempting to get a value for field `service` on serializer `SuperAdminTransactionSerializer`.\nThe 
serializer field might be named incorrectly and not match any attribute or key on the `Transaction` instance.\nOriginal exception text was: 'Transaction' object has 
no attribute 'service'. (Fixed)

(2). I am still working on the "s/related-agencies". (Done)
(3) Who adds the available channels to a service created by the Super Admin ?

- NOTE: Channel Assignment should be added to Super Admin Settings sections, where he/she can be assigned a channel
where the service can be available on.
- NOTE: I have added a service type (paid / free)to the service creation logic, the frontend person would need to add it to his own flow.
- Add a name to the Service Detail, when an Admin is creating a Service.
- Each service would use the Logo of the Agency attached to it's ServiceDetail Model.
- How do we assign service type during service creation.


TODO:
- Revisit the flow for Service. (done)
- Wrap your each service codes in functions. (done)
- Write an endpoint used for updating the service_detail_code for a Service's detail. (done)
- Create an endpoint for creating sub agency in the agency flow. (done)
- Endpoint for partner manager to create agency. (done)
- Email notification. (done)
- logged all 3rd party response
- change verification response:
   - BVN (done)
   - Voters Card (done)
   - TIN (undone: I haven't gotten a real TIN number)
   - CAC (undone: verifMe returns an error message, maybe due to incorrect CAC)
   - Drivers License (done)
- Reversal: In a case where the 3rd party's API is down and not responding, and a user just finished making payment,
  this user's fund is supposed to be reversed.
- change login response.

TODO 2:
====================
- Ask Mr. Albert if verifyMe charges the wallet if the user enters a wrong detail.
- What if a user enters an incorrect verification data, while the service providers "VerifyMe" still charge user ?:
    - collect user details
    - call 3rd party API
    - if success:
        - charge user
        - give user 3rd party response.
    - else:
        - give error response about details
        "But I need to sure that the 3rd doesn't charge tm30's account"
=====================


Questions:
- Should I save and display the Document's ID.
- Can user come back to view already verified documents of should they re-do the process ?

NOTE: Service Code field on the service detail Model is used for Identifying the block of code that needs to be ran when
    - a user selects the service of a Provider.
    - For Voter's Card Registration Service Code will be (VCR01) ***01 which represents the agencies in ascending number


Where to add notifications:
- After a Super Admin adds an Agency to a service.
- After a Super Admin creates a Partner Manager. Partner Manager receives an email for account activation and after password reset.
- Forgot password.
- After a Super Admin / partner manager (activate / deactivate) an Agency's service.
- Approval or Disapproval of Services by the Super Admin / Partner Manager.
- After a Partner Manger creates an Agency, Super Admin needs to be notified for Approval of the Agency on the Platform.
- After a successful registration, the business will wait for approval by the super admin before the business account can be activated.
